# regularizedRegressionModels
Selecting features using ridge regularization, LASSO regularization, and sequential feature selection

This activity is meant to summarize the work with regularized regression models. 

We will build regression models to predict wage. Incorporate the categorical features and transform the target using a logarithm.  We will also Build ridge models and consider different amounts of regularization. After fitting the model, we will interpret it and try to understand what features led to higher wages.
